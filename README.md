### Presentation of the scientific approach:
This work shows how statistical interactions between species and the key forcings driving them can be detected using a relatively simple statistical approach, Granger causality (Granger, 1969).
First, pairwise Granger causality tests were performed to detect and select the strongest interactions and drivers, then followed by Multivariate Auto-Regressive (MAR) modelling techniques to evaluate 
the relevance of the selected causal relationships in a multivariate system.
The method and results have been published in this article: Bensebaini, C. M., Certain, G., Gourguet, S., Th√©baud, O., Hattab, T., Billet, N., Jadaud, A., et al. 2025.
